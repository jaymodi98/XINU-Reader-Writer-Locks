<h2 align="center">PA3: Readers/Writer Locks</h2>
<h2 align="center">Due: Dec 4 2015, 10:00 pm</h2>



<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p> In PA3, you are going to implement readers/writer locks as described below.
</p>

<p> Please download and untar a fresh version of the XINU source at
    <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA3/csc501-lab3.tgz">csc501-lab3.tgz</a>.
    You should NOT use the modified XINU source in which you
    implemented your previous projects. 
</p>

<p> Readers/writer locks are used to synchronize access to a shared
    data structure. A lock can be acquired for read or write
    operations. A lock acquired for reading can be shared by other
    readers, but a lock acquired for writing must be exclusive. 
</p>
<p> You have been provided with the standard semaphore implementation
    for XINU. Make sure you read and understand the XINU semaphore
    system (<font face="Courier New">wait.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">signal.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">screate.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">sdelete.c</font>, etc.) and use that
    as a basis for your locks. You should NOT modify the standard
    semaphore implementation, since semaphores are used in the rest
    of the kernel, e.g., in device drivers. Your task is to extend
    the XINU semaphore to implement the readers/writer lock
    semantics. Although, the standard semaphores implemented in XINU
    are quite useful, there are some issues with the XINU semaphores
    which we will try to fix in this assignment. 
</p>
<p> XINU semaphores do not distinguish between read accesses, which
    can co-exist, and write accesses, which must be exclusive. 
</p>
<p> Another problem with XINU's semaphores occurs when a semaphore is
    deleted at a time when it has processes waiting in its queue. In
    such situation, <font face="Courier New">sdelete</font> awakens
    all the waiting processes by moving them from the semaphore queue
    to the ready list. As a result, a process that is waiting for
    some event to occur will be awakened, even though the event has
    not yet occurred. You need to fix this problem in this PA. 
</p>

<h2>2. Interfaces to Implement</h2>

<p> For this lab you must implement the entire readers/writer lock
    system. This includes code or functions to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> initialize locks (call a function
       <font face="Courier New">linit()</font> from the
       <font face="Courier New">sysinit()</font> function in
       <font face="Courier New">initialize.c</font>) </li>
  <li> create and destroy a lock
       (<font face="Courier New">lcreate()</font> and
       <font face="Courier New">ldelete()</font>)</li>
  <li> acquire a lock and release multiple locks
       (<font face="Courier New">lock()</font> and
       <font face="Courier New">releaseall()</font>)</li>
</ul>

<p> Please create files called <font face="Courier New">linit.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">lcreate.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">ldelete.c</font>,
            <font face="Courier New">lock.c</font>, and
            <font face="Courier New">releaseall.c</font> that contain
    these functions. Use a header file called
    <font face="Courier New">lock.h</font> for your definitions,
    including the constants DELETED, READ and WRITE. The functions
    have to be implemented as explained next:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Create a lock: <font face="Courier New">int lcreate(void)</font>
       - Creates a lock and returns a lock descriptor that can be
       used in further calls to refer to this lock. This call should
       return SYSERR if there are no available entries in the lock
       table. The number of locks allowed is NLOCKS, which you should
       define in <font face="Courier New">lock.h</font> to be 50.</li>
  <li> Destroy a lock: <font face="Courier New">int ldelete (int lockdescriptor)</font>
       - Deletes the lock identified by the descriptor
       <font face="Courier New">lockdescriptor</font>
       (see "Lock Deletion" below). </li>
  <li> Acquisition of a lock for read/write:
       <font face="Courier New">int lock (int ldes1, int type, int priority)</font>
       - This call is explained below ("Wait on locks with Priority"). </li>
  <li> Simultaneous release of multiple locks:
       <font face="Courier New">int releaseall (int numlocks, int ldes1,..., int ldesN)</font> </li>
</ul>


<h3> <i>(1) Lock Deletion</i> </h3>
<p> /* As mentioned before, there is a slight problem with XINU
    semaphores. The way XINU handles <i>sdelete</i> may have
    undesirable effects if a semaphore is deleted while a process
    or processes are waiting on it. Examining the code for wait
    and sdelete, you will notice that sdelete readies processes
    waiting on a semaphore being deleted. So they will return
    from wait with OK. */ As many of you pointed out, the Xinu
    version for PA3 does not have this problem.
</p>

<p> You must implement your lock system such that waiting on a lock
    will return a new constant DELETED instead of OK when returning
    due to a deleted lock. This will indicate to the user that the
    lock was deleted and not unlocked. As before, any calls to
    <font face="Courier New">lock()</font> after the lock is deleted
    should return SYSERR.
</p>

<p> There is also another subtle but important point to note.
    Consider the following scenario. Let us say that there are three
    processes A, B, and C. Let A create a lock with
    <font face="Courier New">descriptor=X</font>. Let A and B use X
    to synchronize among themselves. Now, let us assume that A
    deletes the lock X. But B does not know about that. If, now, C
    tries to create a lock, there is a chance that it gets the same
    lock descriptor as that of X (lock descriptors are limited and
    hence can be reused). When B waits on X the next time, it should
    get a SYSERR. It should not acquire the lock C has now newly
    created, even if this lock has the same id as that of the
    previous one. You have to find a way to implement this facility,
    in addition to the DELETED issue above.
</p>

<h3> <i>(2) Locking Policy</i> </h3>
<p> In your implementation, no readers should be kept waiting unless
    (i) a writer has already obtained the lock, or (ii) there is a
    higher priority writer already waiting for the lock. Hence, when
    a writer or the last reader releases a lock, the lock should be
    next given to a process having the highest waiting priority for
    the lock. In the case of equal waiting priorities, the lock will
    be given to the process that has the longest waiting time (in
    milliseconds) on the lock. If the waiting priorities are equal
    and the waiting time difference is within 1 second, writers
    should be given preference to acquire the lock over readers. In
    any case, if a reader is chosen to have a lock, then all the
    other waiting readers having priority not less than that of the
    highest-priority waiting writer for the same lock should also be
    admitted.
</p>

<h3> <i>(3) Wait on Locks with Priority</i> </h3>
<p> This call allows a process to wait on a lock with priority. The
    call will have the form:
</p>
<pre><font face="Courier New">int lock (int ldes1, int type, int priority)</font></pre>
<p> where priority is any integer priority value (including negative
    values, positive values and zero).
</p>
<p> Thus when a process waits, it will be able to specify a wait
    priority. Rather than simply enqueuing the process at the end of
    the queue, the <font face="Courier New">lock()</font> call should
    now insert the process into the lock's wait list according to the
    wait priority. Please note that the wait priority is different
    from a process's scheduling priority specified in the
    <i>create(</i><i>..)</i> system call. A larger value of the
    priority parameter means a higher priority.
 </p>
<p> Control is returned only when the process is able to acquire the
    lock. Otherwise, the calling process is blocked until the lock
    can be obtained.
</p>

<p> Acquiring a lock has the following meaning: </p>
<p> 1. The lock is free, i.e., no process is owning it. In this case the
    process that requested the lock gets the lock and sets the type of
    locking as READ or WRITE.
</p>
<p>2. Lock is already acquired: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4in;"> a. For READ:<br>
    If the requesting process has specified the lock type as READ and has
    sufficiently high priority (not less than the highest priority writer
    process waiting for the lock), it acquires the lock, else not. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.4in;"> b. For WRITE:<br>
    In this case, the requesting process does not get the lock as WRITE locks are exclusive. </p>

<h3> <i>(4) Releasing Locks</i> </h3>
<p> Simultaneous <i>release</i> allows a process to release one or more
    locks simultaneously. The system call has the form
</p>
<pre><font face="Courier New">int releaseall (int numlocks, int ldes1, ...)</font></pre>
<p> and should be defined according to the locking policy given above.
    Also, each of the lock descriptors must correspond to a lock being
    held by the calling process.
</p>
<p> If there is a lock in the arguments which is not held by calling
    process, this function needs to return SYSERR and should not
    release this lock. However, it will still release other locks
    which are held by the calling process.
</p>
<p> If a process holding a lock is killed, the kill routine is
    resposible to release the lock. 
</p>

<h3> <i>(5) Using Variable Arguments</i> </h3>
<p> The call <font face="Courier New">int releaseall (int numlocks, int ldes1,..., int ldesN)</font>,
    has a variable number of arguments. For instance, it could be:<br>
</p>
<pre><font face="Courier New">releaseall(numlocks,ldes1, ldes2);</font></pre>
<pre><font face="Courier New">releaseall(numlocks,ldes1, ldes2, ldes3, ldes4);</font></pre>
<p> where numlocks = 2 in the first case and numlocks = 4 in the second case. </p>
<p> The first call releases two locks ldes1 and ldes2. The second
    releases four locks. You will not use the va_list/va_arg
    facilities to accommodate variable numbers of arguments, but will
    obtain the arguments directly from the stack. See
    <font face="Courier New">create.c</font> for hints on how to do this.
</p>
